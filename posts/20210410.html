  Pretty immediately after opening my Ender I got overwhelmed as I spread the parts over my limited aparment work area, so I watched a 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-Z3GmM20JM">parts tour & assembly</a> video to get a sense of what I was in for. The video linked says the instructions  included in the box are straightforward if you're
  "mechanically minded"; this may well be true, but I knew that other videos would likely have tips & tricks to ensure better initial assembly. I ended up settling on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me8Qrwh907Q"> this video</a>,
  based mostly off view count/likes. I watched it through once on 2x speed to get a sense of scale, then started from the beginning.
