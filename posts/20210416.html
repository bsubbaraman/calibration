  As I worked through <a href="https://bsubbaraman.github.io/hcde533/assignments/a2/a2.html"> many test prints</a> for digital fabrication class, I ran into a problem where the print (in this case, a cube) would move during the print;
  the first layer(s) were fine, but somewhere after 50% through the entire object would come away from the bed (even with a brim). My first instinct here was to re-level the bed. I ran through manual calibration with receipt paper as discussed in
  the previous entry, but the problem persisted. Then, I cleaned the glass bed with isopropyl alcohol, halved the inital layer sepeed from 20mms<sup>-1</sup> to 10mms<sup>-1</sup> and tried again. A test trying to swipe the base away from the base seemed somewhat firmer, but it could still move. After some searching,
  I tried experimenting with the bed temperature. <br/>
  I was running all prints at the Cura default of 200/60* for nozzle/bed temps respectively. A temperature tower test (LINK) confirmed that 200* is reasonable for my Solutech filament (which checks out with the recommended
  190-210* suggestion on the box). <a href="https://all3dp.com/2/ender-3-pro-glass-bed-adhesion-tips-tricks/"> Resources online</a> suggested trying bed temperatures up to 70* for bed temps, in 5* increments. If the PLA cools too fast,
  it contracts and won't stick, but too high of a temperature will result in a bulged first layer (elephant's foot). Trying out 60*, 65*, and 70* as print bed temps, I settled on the following as my 'enders game' first layer print
  settings; that is, these settings might be 'too much' but they seem to work with some amount of definitiveness. <br/><br/>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>setting</th>
      <th>value</th>
      <th>notes</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <th > initial layer speed </th>
      <td> 10mms<sup>-1</sup></td>
      <td> This is half of the cura default (20mms<sup>-1</sup>) </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <th> nozzle temp </th>
      <td> 200*</td>
      <td> this is the Cura default, aligns with suggested Solutech temps </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <th > initial bed temp </th>
      <td> 70* </td>
      <td> lowering to 65* after first layer. don't notice any bulging. </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <th> support </th>
      <td> brim</td>
      <td> curious about how a brim might 'hide' other calibration errors </td>
    </tr>

  </table>

  <br/><br/>

  A couple points of reflection on this process. There's a certain difficulty in isolating variables I'm encountering because I'm unsure how different steps will play together. For example, in picking a bed temperature, a 
  slower initial speed might make up for a lower bed temperature or conversely a higher bed temp could compensate for a quick initial speed. Some of this might be my newness to things, but there's a combinatorial overwhelming-ness
  to fiddling with these settings. It's also possibel that a better bed leveling might resolve some of this issues too. Moreover, with e.g. printing with a brim, I'm slightly tentative about how using a brim on structures that
  don't really need them might hide other problems. Again, I'm unsure if this is just my naÃ¯vetÃ© showing. 
  <br/>
  After settling on first layer settings, I was able to print a bunch of objects in a row without too much trouble. Satisfying!
